        <p style="color: white;">First of all my name is Aaron Demski and im a 21 year old learning how to code using html and css. Isn't that cool?!? One of my big goals is to become a succesful dev and Epicodus has been a great help at making that come true. Big thanks to them! I also play a lot of video games and love building computers. Ive always wanted to become a race car driver since my family used to be big into racing. We even had our own racing team called Demski Racing. My dad was a the driver and my grandpa and him would work day and night 24/7 working on their race car getting it prepared for their next race. I have a big love for cars, some people may think that working day and night on a race car is ridiculous but its such a good feeling making something yourself and seeing what it looks like when its completed. Which is exactly what I hope to do with my coding skills!</p>
